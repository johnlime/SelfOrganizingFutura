# Self Organizing Futura

`python3 src/svg_stack.py` produces the main poster that showcases the font.

`python3 src/font_editor.py` edits the original Futura font and produces SVG files. Each edges and curves are divided into 100 different parts and are put through Angeniol's Self Organizing Map to produce a "morphing" effect between letters.
